오 신기하다.. 아래 내용을 그저 복사-붙여넣기 했을 뿐인데 알아서 예쁘게 화면에서 보인다.
하지만 아직 사이드바 메뉴 적용이 제대로 안 되고 있어서, 역시 새로운(?) 것은 조금 더 공부를 해야 겠다. 

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

​```python
def print_hi(name):
  print("hello", name)
print_hi('Tom')
​```
